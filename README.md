# Via Láctea - Olavo Bilac

## 📌 About

Website about a poem that was written by Olavo Bilac in the 19th century. The objective of this project 
was to develop something using front-end technologies — and to improve my skills.

A poem is one of the best ways to express yourself, criticize people/our society or maybe talk about a simple
object. Then, after read *"Via Láctea, soneto XIII"*, I had a lot of emotions and wanted to show it
to the others.

This page has accessibility — in other words, there are features that help people to use it, like buttons
that change websites' mode (light or dark) and that increase/decrease the font size. It was organized
thinking to extend the access' ways, including different people.
